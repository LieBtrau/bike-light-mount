The bike light exists in two versions:
* [Cree XML-T6 (1800 lm) light](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1800-Lumen-Super-Bright-XML-T6-LED-Bike-Light-Headlamp-IP65-Waterproof-3-Mode-LED-Bicycle/32698975455.html)
* [3W, 800 lm light (battery powered)](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Waterproof-800LM-3W-Outdoor-Sport-Bike-Bicycle-Light-Headlight-Headlamp-High-Quality-New/32573540736.html)

# Mechanics
The problem with both of these lights is that the bike mount doesn't withstands shocks very well.  The light will shift down on every bump in the road.  The bike mount presented below is much sturdier.

# Electronics
* Problem 1: powering with two CR2032 won't last a very long time
* Problem 2: USB-connectors are not designed for outdoor use and will result in bad contacts.
* Problem 3: When the light is in standby, the green LED drains the battery power. 

The bike mount presented here uses industrial M12-connectors, which can be left connected when not in use.  The circuitry switches off power to the bike light when it's in stanby mode to save power.  
For powering the bike light, a USB-powerbank can be used which can be mounted inside a [tool bottle](http://nl.decathlon.be/gereedschapsbus-500-ml-zwart-id_8123841.html).
